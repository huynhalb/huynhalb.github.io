<h1>Hello World</h1>

<p>Discovery, continuous improvement,
  and a pursuit of greater understanding
  of others and the world are the pillars
  upon which I’ve built my career in life
  thus far.</p>

<p>Pursuing an Engineering Education Specialist
  M.A.Sc. in Industrial Engineering at the
  University of Toronto, these guiding principles
  have led me to focus my attention on improving
  technical education/training and development.
  I currently work in leadership development for
  engineering students (undergraduate and graduate)
  and young professionals. Leveraging my dual
  background in chemical engineering and education,
  I’m constantly looking for new ways to hybridize
  technical learning with personal development,
  particularly through the lens of engineering
  design and social innovation.</p>

<p>My experience has shown me that the greatest
  reward is to help others to fulfill their own
  potential and realize their true values, whether
  encouraging colleagues to speak up about issues
  or to push people to take risks and pursue their
  vision for a better world, nothing is more
  powerful than being able to cultivate the
  talent of those around you. </p>
